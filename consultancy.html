        <h4>Aircraft Feasibility</h4>
        The decision to charter, lease or buy an aircraft is complex. In the simplest terms making the right choice depends on how many hours the aircraft will be used. The first step is to conduct a needs-based assessment to determine what options best suit your needs from an operational and financial perspective.

        <h4>Aircraft Acquisition</h4>
        Based on the results of the needs assessment, we will assist you in acquiring and, if necessary, managing your aircraft. Air charters are often the easiest way to begin using aircraft services. You simply pay for the cost of the flight or, in the case of an ad-hoc charter, the space used, with no other commitments. Typically, it’s best for those flying around 50 hours or less per year. Aircraft leasing is for more intensive usage over a period of 1-24 months. Leasing ensures that the aircraft is available for a minimum number of hours with options for total or self-management of the aircraft. Purchase of a new or used aircraft through an operational or financial lease, gives you complete control of an aircraft and can be the most cost-effective option for heavy usage or special needs.

        <h4>Aircraft Management</h4>
        Aircraft management is the supervision of the piloting, maintenance, positioning, and care of an aircraft. Whether you choose to charter, lease or purchase an aircraft, we can provide the level of oversight or management you require. For aircraft operating in remote or hostile locations we specialize in providing complete remote site management that includes liaising with local civilian and military authorities to establish flight operations on civilian airfields, military bases or in remote areas where a base of operations may need to be established from the ground up.
